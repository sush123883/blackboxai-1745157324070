# Canteen Management and User Ordering App

## Project Overview

The Canteen Management and User Ordering App is a comprehensive solution designed to facilitate user interactions with a canteen system. This app is tailored for both users and administrators, offering functionalities such as user registration, menu browsing, order placement, payment integration, order tracking, and an admin dashboard for managing inventory and sales. The project aims to bridge the gap between users and canteen services, making the ordering experience seamless and efficient.

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React Native (cross-platform mobile app)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: MongoDB (NoSQL)
- **Payment Gateway**: Stripe
- **Hosting**: Heroku (backend), Expo or app stores (frontend)

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/canteen-management-app.git
   cd canteen-management-app
   ```

2. **Set up the backend**
   - Navigate to the backend directory:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     ```
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Create a `.env` file and configure your MongoDB URI and Stripe keys.
   - Start the backend server:
     ```bash
     node server.js
     ```

3. **Set up the frontend**
   - Navigate to the frontend directory:
     ```bash
     cd ../frontend
     ```
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Start the frontend app:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

## Usage

Once the backend and frontend servers are running:

1. **User Registration**: Users can create an account using email or phone.
2. **Menu Browsing**: Users can browse the menu, filter items, and view item details.
3. **Order Placement**: Users can add items to their cart and place orders.
4. **Payment**: Users can make payments through the integrated Stripe service.
5. **Order Tracking**: Users can track the status of their orders in real-time.
6. **Admin Dashboard**: Admins can manage the menu, view orders, handle inventory, and analyze sales.
